Work and Reflections from CS-320 at Southern New Hampshire University

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by using testing. The automated tests will ensure that my code functions as intended and meets the requirements
laid out in the software requirements portion of the software development life cycle. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by using the software requirements as a guideline or backbone for the program. Going through the requirements
and incorporating them one by one will allow me to ensure the customers needs are met in the final product.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software linearly, one step at a time. This may mean breaking one large requirement up into smaller requirements and building those requirements
one at a time. It may also mean jumping around the requirements to knock out smaller ones before tackling bigger ones. The most important part is that all requirements 
are met in the end.
